# Visual Network Configuration of Operation and Maintenance Based on SDN
## Rational
Because the traditional network management network equipment configuration is tedious, it needs to use the command line to configure one by one, manual operation will lead to the risk of operational errors; and the traditional network maintenance is difficult: the deployment of the new protocol and troubleshooting make network maintenance a very difficult task. In the SDN environment, SDN separates data from control by using the idea of hierarchy. In the control layer, including the logic centralized and programmable controller, it can master the global network information, facilitate operators and researchers to manage and configure the network and deploy new protocols. So we think about the visual network configuration and operation and maintenance in the SDN environment.
